To learn from the CCS case study, you should focus on mastering the following key concepts in healthcare:

## Chronic Care Management
Understanding chronic conditions, particularly diabetes, is crucial. This includes:
- Long-term patient care strategies
- Prevention of co-morbidities
- Holistic health approaches

## Data Analytics in Healthcare
Proficiency in data analytics is essential, encompassing:
- Customer Analytics Record (CAR) development
- Integration of internal data with social determinants of health
- Creation of longitudinal patient views

## Artificial Intelligence and Predictive Modeling
Mastering AI applications in healthcare is vital:
- Development of AI-powered predictive models
- Evaluation of multiple predictive models for optimal performance
- Understanding model accuracy and predictive power

## Patient Adherence
Grasping the concept of patient adherence is key:
- Strategies to improve adherence in high-risk patient cohorts
- Predictive analysis of patient behavior
- Intervention programs to keep patients on track with treatments

## Personalized Patient Care
Understanding personalized care approaches is crucial:
- Tailored outreach strategies
- Patient engagement techniques
- Consideration of patient communication preferences

## Healthcare Economics
Knowledge of healthcare economics is important:
- Cost savings through improved adherence
- Impact of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) on costs
- Waste avoidance in medical equipment setup

## Healthcare Technology Infrastructure
Familiarity with healthcare IT systems is beneficial:
- Integration with existing data environments (e.g., Azure Data Lake)
- Implementation of advanced analytics programs

## Proactive Care Management
Understanding proactive care strategies is essential:
- Identifying high-risk individuals before issues escalate
- Preventing emergency room visits and hospitalizations
- Transitioning from reactive to proactive care models

By mastering these concepts, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of the innovative approaches used in the CCS case study to improve diabetes care through predictive AI and data analytics[1][2].
